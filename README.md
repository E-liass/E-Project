# E-Project
Networking development on PC - 
This poweshell script is to discover IPv4 addresses of end devices connected to same LAN

The upcoming project related to it will function same as nmap with additional features.

Aim:
To discover connected device on LAN, 
To detect if device is connected or disconnected, usefull for troubleshoot

The objective of the program is to build friendly GUI interface displaying all devices connected to corporate LAN,
easy to identify new conncction or lost connection of each end device.
Additionally, I would love to feature it as customizable naming entry (for example: Printer HR dept - User: Mr Xavier - Ip x.x.x.x - OS/firmware version - Status On/Off - last time ON)
